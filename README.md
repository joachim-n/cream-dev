cream-dev
=========


Install profile + makefile for CREAM. Really pared down -- stripped all non-essential contrib modules.
Untested, due to testing makefiles taking bloody AGES.

Usage:

$ drush make profiles/cream/cream.make

Install Drupal with the Cream profile.

Download and install your favourite toolbar/admin module and admin theme.

If this all works (!!) you should be able to create schedules and sessions. See the timetable module README for more info for now.
